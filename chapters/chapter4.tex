\chapter{Local algorithm}\label{ch:local}
%************************************************

The infrastructure is set up, and the Monte Carlo updating of link variables has to be defined.

In this chapter will be firstly introduced the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,
and explained how it can be used to compute expectation values.

Then, a specific local algorithm will be defined to compute the integral of Equation \eqref{eq:lat_exp}.
The first simulation will be run,
and the result of the plaquette mean value will be compared with the value reported by D\"urr and Hoelbling in 2005 \cite{durr-hoelbling:2005}.

However, since the algorithm is local, at small lattice spacing, the topological freezing will be encountered.
